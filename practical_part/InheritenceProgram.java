/**
 * Inheritance: Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). 
 * It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 
 * 
 * Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as superclass(or a base class or a parent class).
 * Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived class, extended class, or child class). 
 * The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
 * Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of "reusability", i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already 
 * a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. 
 * By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class. 
 * 
 * The keyword used for inheritance is extends.

        //In the above program, when an object of MountainBike class is created, a copy of all methods and fields of the

        //members of a superclass. during inheritance only the object of the subclass is created, not the superclass.

        //1. Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. 
        // like class A -> class B
        B b = new B();
        b.print_geek();
        b.print_for();
        b.print_geek();

        //2. Multilevel Inheritance: A derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as 
        //the derived class also act as the base class to other class. like Class One -> Two -> Three 
        Three g = new Three();
        g.print_geek();
        g.print_for();
        g.print_geek();

        //3. Hierarchical Inheritance: One class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one subclass.
        //4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces): One class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.
        //Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. We can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.
        child c = new child();
        c.print_geek();
        c.print_for();
        c.print_geek();

        //5. Hybrid Inheritance: It is a mix of two or more of the above types of inheritance. Since java doesnâ€™t support 
        //multiple inheritances with classes, hybrid inheritance is also not possible with classes. we can achieve 
        //hybrid inheritance only through Interfaces.

//Important facts about inheritance: 
//Default superclass: Except Object class, which has no superclass, every class has one and only one direct superclass(single inheritance). 
//In the absence of any other explicit superclass, every class is implicitly a subclass of the Object class.

//Superclass can only be one: A superclass can have any number of subclasses. But a subclass can have only one superclass. 
//This is because Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes. Although with interfaces, multiple inheritances are supported by java.

//Inheriting Constructors: A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. 
//Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

//Private member inheritance: A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, 
//if the superclass has public or protected methods(like getters and setters) for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.
