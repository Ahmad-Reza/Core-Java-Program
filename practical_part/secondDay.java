/**
# why java is simple:
- java is a Plateform independent language
- there is no concept of pointer
- there is no concept of memory management in the hand of developer
    (memory management is done by JVM by GArbage collector).
- In java all programming component are binded together into a single Unit "Class"
    programming component(ex: variable, method)

# diff between C++ and java Class:
a.) Class in C++ is collection of data/variable, function
   ex: class test{
        public: // access modifier
        variable;
        function;
    }
    int main(){
        //write some codes.
    }
b.) Class in Java is collection of variable, method, main.
   ex: public class test{
        int var;
        void animal();
        main();
    }
=> variable - to hold data value
=> method - to perform action       
=> main() - to start the execution of program

# Parts/Modules of Java language(james ghosling):-
    1. java SE(standard edition)/core java
    2. java EE(Enterprise edition)/advance java
    3. java ME(micro/machine/mobile edition) - outdated

# core java :- 
- core java provides the fundamentals building blocks are used in cunstructing 
  java programing which are also known as programing component(variable, methods, blocks).
  ex: standalone application, android app etc

# advance java :- JDBC/JSP/Servlet
- advance java means java program which can integrating with non-java programming components.
- java program integrating with CUI(console user interface), GUI(graphics user interface), Web.

a) CUI(console user interface): interacts with console input(command prompt) are known as CUI
b) GUI(graphics user interface): interacts with graphics components are known as GUI

# programing component:
- variable 
- methods
- blocks
- constructor
- class
- interface
- abstract class

# concept of java:
- Oops(Object oriented programing structure)
- Exception handling
- collection framework
- GUI programing(AWT/swing/Applet)

c) JDK(java development kit) - in which have java compiler for compilation and JVM for execution.
    note: in real time developer computer have JDK software
d) JRE(java run/real time enviroment) - in which have only JVM for execution process(there is no java compiler)
e) JVM(java virtual machine): which is available in JDK & JRE, this jvm runs independently in the process of executing java byte code(.class)
    eg: JDK(JRE(development tools(javac, java), JVM(.jar etc)))

f) Virtual Machine - the software component which internally having the behaviour like machine is known as virtual machine.
