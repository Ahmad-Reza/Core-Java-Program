/**
 * Singleton classes: As the name implies, a class is said to be singleton if it limits the number of objects of that class to one. 
 * We canâ€™t have more than a single object for such classes. 
 * Singleton classes are employed extensively in concepts like Networking and Database Connectivity.
 * 
 * The constructor of singleton class would be private so there must be another way to get the instance of that class. 
 * This problem is resolved using a class member instance and a factory method to return the class member.
